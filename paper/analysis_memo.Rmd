## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click theKnit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
table_1_ft
```

I can write things about this table calling specific details from the table without having to type in a number! For example: 


The median (IQR) age among study participants is`r inline_text(table_1, variable = 'Age (years)')`. Additionally, `r inline_text(table_1, 'PHQ-2 category', level = 'PHQ-2 >=3')` participants have a PHQ-2 score greater than or equal to 3, requiring referral.
